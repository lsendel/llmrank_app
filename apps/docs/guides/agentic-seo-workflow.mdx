# Agentic SEO Workflow

Use LLM Boost tools to run a complete SEO optimization cycle from your AI assistant.

## The Workflow

### 1. Set Up Project

```
"Create a project for docs.example.com called 'Example Docs'"
```

### 2. Run Initial Crawl

```
"Start a crawl for my project"
```

Wait for the crawl to complete (check with `get_crawl_status`).

### 3. Review Scores

```
"Show me my site's AI readiness score breakdown"
```

### 4. Identify Issues

```
"List the critical issues on my site"
```

### 5. Get Recommendations

```
"What should I fix first to improve my score?"
```

### 6. Generate Fixes

```
"Generate a fix for the MISSING_LLMS_TXT issue"
```

### 7. Check AI Visibility

```
"Check if my site appears in ChatGPT when people ask about 'project management tools'"
```

### 8. Track Progress

After making fixes, run another crawl and compare:

```
"Start a new crawl and compare the results with the previous one"
```
